## Background

In South Africa, itâ€™s common for teenagers to manipulate the digits in their ID
numbers to gain entry to clubs and other 18+ establishments.

However, many are unaware that the last digit in a South African ID serves as a
checksum. This checksum digit helps detect any alterations to the preceding
digits.

Our application performs precisely this function: it recalculates the checksum
and compares it with the ID number. The primary goal of this application is to
offer relevant businesses in South Africa an added layer of security. By
preventing underage teenagers from accessing alcohol, it helps safeguard their
liquor licenses.
